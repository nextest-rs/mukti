# mukti

A simple release manager. Used by [cargo nextest](https://nexte.st).

This is currently not ready to be used by others, though it might get there some day. If you're looking at this, consider [cargo-dist](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/). (It is a long-term goal that nextest uses cargo-dist.)
